    Input
    ----------
    spot_setup: class
        model: function 
            Should be callable with a parameter combination of the parameter-function 
            and return an list of simulation results (as long as evaluation list)
        parameter: function
            When called, it should return a random parameter combination. Which can 
            be e.g. uniform or Gaussian
        objectivefunction: function 
            Should return the objectivefunction for a given list of a model simulation and 
            observation.
        evaluation: function
            Should return the true values as return by the model.

    dbname: str
        Name of the database where parameter, objectivefunction value and simulation 
        results will be saved.
    dbformat: str
         ram: fast suited for short sampling time. no file will be created and results are saved in an array.
        csv: A csv file will be created, which you can import afterwards.        
    parallel: str
        seq: Sequentiel sampling (default): Normal iterations on one core of your cpu.
        mpc: Multi processing: Iterations on all available cores on your (single) pc
        mpi: Message Passing Interface: Parallel computing on high performance computing clusters, py4mpi needs to be installed

    alt_objfun: str or None, default: 'rmse'
        alternative objectivefunction to be used for algorithm
        * None: the objfun defined in spot_setup.objectivefunction is used
        * any str: if str is found in spotpy.objectivefunctions, 
            this objectivefunction is used, else falls back to None 
            e.g.: 'log_p', 'rmse', 'bias', 'kge' etc.
